uplods things in aws s3 

1.flow 
    sent data in backend 
    then sent the image/video/audio to the s3 bucket

2.Presigned url
    Directly sent image/video from frontend to the s3 bucket 
    flow of this 
        1.whenver user select image for upload 
        2.then frontend send a get request to the backend that is /getPresignedUrl 
        3.then backend get url from aws s3 and then send url to the fronted and with the help of this url frontend can upload image to s3
        4.after upload fronted get the meta data of upload ,then this meta data with some details (like product details in case of ecommerce) sent to the backend again for reference


CDN is used for access the private s3 ,for getting the access of image/video directly from aws without cdn then s3 ko public rkhna pdega





1.create a bucket in the aws
2.create user that can access that bucket
3.create custom policy for giving acces anly to put object in bucket
4.attach that policy to the user
5.create access key for that user and keep it in the backnd env
